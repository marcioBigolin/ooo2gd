Short description and help for OOo2GD [here](http://ooo2gd.przemelek.pl/)

Times change, and APIs change. So not all features work now :-(
Here  short table showing what works:
| Document type | Upload as GD doc | Upload file | Update as GD doc | Update file | Open GD doc | Open file |
|:--------------|:-----------------|:------------|:-----------------|:------------|:------------|:----------|
| Text document | OK | OK | OK | OK | Doesn't work :-( | Doesn't work |
| Spreadsheet | OK | OK | OK | OK | OK | OK |
| Presentation (as PPT) | OK | OK | OK | OK | Doesn't work :-( | Doesn't work |
| Drawings | N/A | OK | N/A | OK | Doesn't work :-( | OK |

Autoupdate doesn't work at all.

Where OOo2GD works for sure (I tested it personally):
| System | LibreOffice | OpenOffice.org |
|:-------|:------------|:---------------|
| Windows 7 | 3 and 4 | 3.x |
| Linux (Ubuntu) | 3 | 3.x |

You need to have Java installed to make OOo2GD work.

**Ubuntu 9.10** users, please read #7 on [KnownIssues](KnownIssues.md).

**Mac OS X** users, please read [MacOS\_Support](MacOS_Support.md) (it worked with OS X 10.4 aka Tiger, now it doesn't work because Apple changed something in theirs Java, and now any of Java extensions for OO.org doesn't work).

**If you have problems with OOo2GD** create [Issue](http://code.google.com/p/ooo2gd/issues/list) or go to [my Google Profile](https://profiles.google.com/przemelek/) and use it to communicate with me.

Easy way to export and import your documents from OpenOffice.org 2.0.4+ or StarOffice 8+ to Google Docs, Zoho & WebDAV servers.

To download it go to [Downloads](http://code.google.com/p/ooo2gd/downloads/list) or to [OOo2GD side in OpenOffice.org extensions repository](http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/project/ooo2gd)

You will need Java 5 SE and OpenOffice.org 2+ or StarOffice 8+ (LibreOffice 3.3 and OO.org 3.3 works too, those OO.org 2+ and StarOffice 8+ are minimal versions needed to work with OOo2GD).
