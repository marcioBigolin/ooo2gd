# Supported Operating Systems. #

For now AddOn works under:
  * Windows (tested under Windows XP Home/Pro in Polish and English edition).
  * Linux (tested on Ubuntu 7.04 with Java 6)
  * Vista Home Premium 32-bit, Java SE 6, OpenOffice 2.4.1
  * OpenSolaris 32-bit and 64-bit, Java SE 6, OpenOffice 3.0

AddOn should also works under other systems.
If somebody tried it under any other OS please inform [me](http://www.przemelek.pl/kontakt).

For work AddOn needs Sun Java 6, also OpenOffice must be configured to use Sun Java 6 (if you have more then one JVM in your system (very common situation) probably you need to set proper for OpenOfficem, instruction how do it you may find in [KnownIssues](KnownIssues.md))
